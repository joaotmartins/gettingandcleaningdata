# gettingandcleaningdata

This repository contains the code for the programming assignment of the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

The code consists of a single script, called run_analysis.R. This script will assume the UCI HAR dataset has been 
de-compressed to the current directory, and will produce a tidy summary of all average values of every variable in the original dataset. See the CodeBook.md file for a detailed description of the steps the script performs, and a detailed description of the produced output.
